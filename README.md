<h1> What is Atomic Design ? </h1>
</br>
  <p> The Atomic Design methodology created by Brad Frost is a design methodology for crafting robust design systems with an explicit order and hierarchy. As the name suggests, it’s derived from a basic chemistry concept; the composition of all matter </p>
  <p> The levels of Atomic Design are as follows : 
    <ul>
    <li>Subatomic Particles </li>
       <li>Atoms </li>
         <li>Molecules</li>
           <li>Organisms </li>
           <li>Templates</li>
             <li>Pages</li>



   </ul>
  
  
  </p>

  <h2> All matter is made up of tiny particles called Atoms.
      
</h2>

</br>
<p> 
   Brad Frost's approach to design systems is based on the same chemistry principle. The principle of Atomic Design focuses on the breaking down of interfaces into smaller parts called atoms. The atoms act as the building blocks for the entire design system. This may seem like a straightforward process, but it can quickly become quite complex depending on the complexity of the project.

<p> 
Subatomic particles
The subatomic particles would be the bare-minimum foundational elements you’d need for all your components. These consists of elements like your color palette, typography, shadows, and spacing.
</p>

<p>
Atoms
atoms in design systems are the smallest elements that cannot be broken down further. These include things like buttons, input fields, switches, etc. 
</p>

<p> 
Molecules
molecules that are combinations of multiple atoms.
Ex Card Items

</p>

<p>
Organisms
These are the highest complexity levels of any given interface component.
 The header, menu bar, data grids, etc., are the commonly defined organisms in most design systems
</p>

<p>
Templates in design systems help define a standard page layout across multiple pages with similar functionality. Templates are standardized layouts for organizing atoms, molecules, and organisms across your product.
</p>

<p> 
Pages
Pages in atomic design are instances of templates in our user interface. Pages are what our users will see in the finished product.</p>
